Stock market skript that uses real life prices


So, I made a stock market skript that uses real life prices, It does this through something called an api
For this to work, you need to generate your own api key, the api I used here was called realstonks

all you have to do is sign up, then copy paste the key you get into the option named key

ontop of this I included a simple economy, u can delete/change it, but you will also have to edit the code
like the part that lets players buy/sell

msg me on discord for help to _dialed#0001

you need some basic skript knowledge to install this.
might add leaderboards and /stockpay later, idk, but have fun
